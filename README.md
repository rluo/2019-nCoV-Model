# 2019-nCoV-Model

A simple model for new confimed 2019-nCoV cases by Provinces in mainland China.

Data from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_2019%E2%80%9320_Wuhan_coronavirus_outbreak

Infectious disease is not my research area. This is only a simple model for academic discussions. This does not represent any view on this matter.

Not vetted and play the model with caution.

Used Jupyter + R for this project.
